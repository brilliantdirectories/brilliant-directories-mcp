# ANTI-SLOP: Writing voice and pattern bans

Mandatory before generating any user-facing prose. Applies to post bodies, FAQ, meta descriptions, titles, anchor text, attribution.

## Voice target

Friend telling someone about a cool local thing. Generous with specifics, no padding, no press-release tone. Name specific things. Trust the reader. Vary sentence length. Link generously.

## Banned

| Pattern | Examples / fix |
|---|---|
| En-dash (`–`, U+2013) and em-dash (`—`, U+2014) | Use commas, periods, parens, or "to" for ranges. Banned everywhere. |
| Throat-clearing openers | "Here's the thing/what/why", "It turns out", "The truth is", "Let me be clear", "What you need to know" → cut, state the point |
| Binary contrasts / negative listing | "Not X. Y." / "isn't X, it's Y" / "Not a concert. Not a conference. It's Z." → just say Y |
| Dramatic fragmentation | "Two days. Two stages. That's it." → combine into a real sentence |
| Rhetorical setups | "What if I told you...", "Think about it:", "Here's what I mean:", Wh- sentence-starters in prose → restructure. **Exempt: FAQ question labels** ("When is...?", "Where does...?", "How much...?") — those are structural Q&A, not prose openers. |
| Inanimate as actor | "decisions emerge", "data tells us", "markets reward", "culture shifts" → name the human |
| Passive voice | "was created", "is believed", "mistakes were made" → name the actor |
| Adverb crutches | really, just, literally, genuinely, honestly, simply, actually, deeply, truly, fundamentally, inherently, inevitably, interestingly, importantly, crucially, ultimately → delete |
| Business jargon | navigate, unpack, lean into, deep dive, double down, circle back, take a step back, moving forward, at its core, at the end of the day, when it comes to, in today's landscape, game-changer → plain language |
| Performative emphasis | "Let that sink in", "Make no mistake", "Full stop", "Period.", "And that's okay" → cut |
| Vague declaratives | "significant", "important", "the implications are", "the stakes are" without naming the specific thing → name it |
| Telling not showing | "this is incredibly difficult", "this is what leadership looks like" → demonstrate with specifics |
| Fabricated authority | "studies show", "experts agree", "research suggests" without citation → cite or rewrite as opinion |
| Lazy extremes | every, always, never, everyone, nobody without specifics → use real numbers or "most"/"many"/"few" |

## Self-check before posting

1. Any `–` (U+2013) or `—` (U+2014) outside code? Rewrite.
2. Throat-clearing opener? Cut.
3. "Not X, it's Y" / negative listing? State Y.
4. Banned adverb / jargon? Delete or replace.
5. Passive voice? Name the actor.
6. Inanimate-as-actor? Name the person.
7. Vague declarative? Name the specific.
8. Stacked fragments? Combine.
9. Performative emphasis? Cut.
10. Three same-length sentences in a row? Vary one.
11. Unsourced authority claim? Cite or rewrite.
12. Lazy extreme? Add specifics.
13. Wh- sentence opener in prose? Restructure. (FAQ question labels exempt.)
14. Paragraph rhythm: 2-4 paragraphs between H2/H3 headings, 3-6 sentences each, varied — not metronomic. Back-to-back larger paragraphs encouraged when content supports it; asymmetrical sizing reads more human than uniform blocks.

## Scoring (rate 1-10, ship if ≥40/50)

| Dimension | Question |
|---|---|
| Directness | Statements or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied sentence length, or metronomic? |
| Trust | Respects reader intelligence, no over-explaining? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human-typed? |
| Density | Padding cut, substance kept? A short shallow post fails this — depth from specifics, examples, and useful context is not padding. |

## Drift triggers (stop and rewrite)

Wh- sentence-starter in prose (FAQ labels exempt). Hedging every claim. Explaining what you're about to say. Padding when data doesn't support length. Three "and"s in one sentence.

## Wrong-example reference

The code block in this section contains the banned U+2014 character — included so you can recognize the pattern. Do NOT write text like this:

```
Tickets cost $20—$45 for the Saturday show — bring sunscreen.
```

Right:

```
Tickets cost $20 to $45 for the Saturday show. Bring sunscreen.
```

## Scope

Prose only. See `METHODOLOGY.md` (research/gates/dedup/hard-rules), `URL-PATTERNS.md` (links).
