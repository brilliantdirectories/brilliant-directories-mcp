# GEOCODING: Nominatim protocol for post types with a place anchor

Applies to content types that set `lat`/`lon` — their runbook's geocoding step points here. Run on survivors (candidates that passed the runbook's dedup step).

BD's `auto_geocode=1` requires a Google Maps server-side API key most sites lack. Skill geocodes itself via Nominatim (OpenStreetMap, free, no key).

## MANDATORY: transliterate non-Latin scripts BEFORE any Nominatim query

Nominatim returns **wrong-country ghost matches** on native non-Latin scripts — confirmed live: `"Ακρόπολη, Αθήνα"` (Acropolis in Greek) returns Helsinki, Finland coords; `"台北101, 台北"` (Taipei 101) returns Iceland; `"故宫, 北京"` returns empty. The English transliteration of the same address resolves correctly every time.

Scan the address string first. If it contains characters outside the Latin alphabet + extended Latin (Greek, Cyrillic, CJK Chinese/Japanese/Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, Thai, etc.), **convert to English/transliterated form before running the retry ladder.** Use the source page's English version if available, or LLM judgment for well-known landmark names ("Acropolis, Athens, Greece"; "Forbidden City, Beijing, China"; "Taipei 101, Taipei, Taiwan"). If neither source nor confident LLM judgment yields an English form, skip `lat`/`lon` for this post entirely. Never pass native script to Nominatim. Never fabricate a transliteration.

## Adaptive retry ladder (run on the transliterated address; accept the lowest-numbered tier that hits)

Nominatim is uneven — over-scoped queries (venue + street + city + region + zip + country) miss; medium-scoped queries (venue + city + region OR street + city + region) hit. Spelled-out state names beat 2-letter codes (`"Florida"` not `"FL"`). For international without state-equivalents, use country in place of state. Each tier is one `WebFetch` to `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=<URL-encoded-q>&format=json&limit=1&addressdetails=1` using the prompt in the `Extraction prompt` section.

**When `post_venue` is known — 4 tiers:**

1. `q="<venue>, <city>, <state-name>"` (US/CA) OR `q="<venue>, <city>, <country>"` (intl). Highest specificity AND highest hit rate — Nominatim has named venues indexed.
2. `q="<street>, <city>, <state-name>"` OR `q="<street>, <city>, <country>"`. Catches venues that aren't named in Nominatim but have indexed street addresses.
3. `q="<venue>, <state-name>"` (US/CA) OR `q="<venue>, <country>"` (intl). Looser — landmark-level match.
4. `q="<city>, <state-name>"` OR `q="<city>, <country>"`. City-center fallback. Always resolves for any recognized city (venue-level accuracy lost).

**When `post_venue` is empty (source page only gave a street address) — 2 tiers:**

1. `q="<street>, <city>, <state-name>"` OR `q="<street>, <city>, <country>"`.
2. `q="<city>, <state-name>"` OR `q="<city>, <country>"`.

After all tiers empty → skip `lat`/`lon` on that post. Post still creates.

## Extraction prompt

For each `WebFetch` tier call: `"Extract from this Nominatim JSON response: (1) lat as a decimal, (2) lon as a decimal, (3) country_code (ISO 2-letter), (4) state name from the address breakdown (full name as returned, e.g. 'New York', 'California', 'Ontario'). Return as a flat object with keys: lat, lon, country_code, state_name. Omit keys whose values are not present in the response."`

## Rules

- ≥1 second between Nominatim rounds (Nominatim ToS).
- Cache within run: two posts at same venue → geocode once.
- Never fabricate coords. Never use LLM-knowledge coordinates.

## Normalize Nominatim output before passing to BD

Nominatim returns `country_code` lowercase (`"us"`, `"ca"`, `"gb"`) and state as a full name (`"New York"`, `"Ontario"`). BD's `country_sn` and `state_sn` expect uppercase ISO codes. Normalize directly.

1. **`country_sn`**: uppercase the Nominatim `country_code`. `"us"` → `"US"`, `"ca"` → `"CA"`, `"gb"` → `"GB"`.
2. **`state_sn`**: map the Nominatim state name to its ISO-3166-2 2-letter code (US: `"New York"` → `"NY"`, `"California"` → `"CA"`; Canada: `"Ontario"` → `"ON"`, `"British Columbia"` → `"BC"`; Australia: `"New South Wales"` → `"NSW"`; etc.). Always uppercase. If the country has no state-equivalent (e.g. Malta, Luxembourg, Singapore) or Nominatim returned a sub-region that isn't a standard ISO-3166-2 subdivision, **OMIT `state_sn`** — pass `country_sn` alone.

Pass `lat`, `lon`, `country_sn`, and `state_sn` (when applicable). Do NOT pass `auto_geocode=1`.
