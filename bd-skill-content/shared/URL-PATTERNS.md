# URL-PATTERNS: BD internal URL construction

Read before generating any internal link. Universal across post types.

**Never fabricate an internal URL.** If you can't verify the target exists, omit the link or section.

## Patterns

| # | Pattern | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Specific post | `/<post_filename>` | BD stores the data_filename prefix AS PART OF `post_filename` (e.g., `events/austin-tech-summit-2026`). Use verbatim with `/` prefix. Only link posts that are live — the resolved row's `post_status=1`; never drafts. |
| 2 | Post type main listing | `/<data_filename>` | From the cached `data_filename` on the resolved post type (already in agent memory from site context). Varies per site (`/events`, `/calendar`, etc.). |
| 3 | Filtered listing | `/<data_filename>?<filters>` | See the `Pattern 3 filter params` section. |
| 4 | Specific member profile | `/<user.filename>` | Resolve via `searchUsers` only — its results mirror the public member search, so the target is publicly findable. A member surfaced any other way passes only via the searchable-plan check: their plan on `listMembershipPlans` has `searchable=1` AND `search_membership_permissions` contains `visitor`. Never `/listing/<id>`. |
| 5 | Member directory landing — entire directory | `/<getSiteInfo.main_directory_url_relative>` | The directory landing page, cached from the run's `getSiteInfo` call. Lists every member, no location or category filter applied. Use when no category or location qualifier fits the sentence. Anchor text names who the page lists ("certified personal trainers"), never site furniture ("member directory," "browse listings"). **Takes NO query parameters** — appending `?category[]=...` or `?lat=...` does not work; Pattern 3's filter params apply to POST listings only, never to the member directory. For filtered member directory links, use Pattern 6. |
| 6 | Member directory — filtered by location and/or category | `/<slug-hierarchy>` | Slug-hierarchy URL that narrows the member directory by category and/or location (e.g. `/california/los-angeles/personal-trainer`). See the `Pattern 6 — Filtered member directory` section for the full construction recipe. |

WebPage-backed link patterns (custom `list_seo` pages with arbitrary slugs, hand-built WebPages) are OUT OF SCOPE for content-creation skills — those require `listWebPages` discovery and belong to the future `/bd:seo` skill. Pattern 6 slug-hierarchy URLs are NOT in this category — BD's dynamic router resolves them natively, no WebPage lookup needed.

## Pattern 3 filter params (universal, every post type)

| Param | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | `q=keyword` | How BD renders its own tag links — recognition only. Skill-built links never use `q=`: every filter runs through `category[]`/location/date params below (verifiable against the category ledger and geo data; `q=` is not). |
| `category[]` | `category[]=Category%20Name` | Repeat for multi-category. Skill defaults to single-category. |
| `daterange` | `daterange=mm%2Fdd%2Fyyyy+-+mm%2Fdd%2Fyyyy` | Single-day = same date both sides. |
| `lat` / `lng` / `location_value` / `location_type` | `lat=46.7534&lng=-92.0681&location_value=Duluth%2C+MN+55802&location_type=locality` | **Send all four together — `location_type` is required even though `lat`/`lng` do the search.** `lat`/`lng` drive the geo radius (implicit default from site settings). `location_value` is the human-readable label that BD writes into the sidebar search-form input. `location_type` toggles the sidebar form's mode (city vs ZIP) — omit it and BD's URL parser breaks, returning zero results. Use `location_type=locality` for city-level (default for content-skill links). Use `location_type=postal_code` for ZIP-radius filtering on sites where the city is too broad (e.g. dense metros). Use the post's `post_location` string for `location_value` regardless of mode. |

## Encoding rules

1. Spaces in `category[]`: `%20`, NOT `+` (BD strips `+`).
2. Slashes in `daterange`: `%2F`. `+` inside `daterange` IS the space-around-hyphen separator.
3. Ampersands in category names: URL-encode (`Food%20%26%20Beverage`).
4. Multi-category: repeat `category[]=A&category[]=B`. Default single.
5. **`&` in `href` attributes of HTML-embedded URLs (e.g. inside `post_content`): escape as `&amp;`** per HTML5 spec. Browsers + Froala both accept raw `&` for non-entity sequences, but `?ref=foo&copy=yes` becomes `?ref=foo©=yes` because the parser interprets `&copy` as the copyright entity. The URL examples in this file show URL syntax (raw `&`); when wrapping any URL in `<a href="...">` for `post_content`, output `&amp;` instead.

## Pattern 6 — Filtered member directory (slug-hierarchy URLs)

**Use when:** anchor text names a specific category and/or location for the member directory (e.g. "running coach in NYC", "yoga instructors in Austin", "personal trainers in Brazil"). When no category or location qualifier fits, use Pattern 5.

**Do NOT call `createWebPage`.** BD's dynamic router resolves these URLs natively. No WebPage needs to exist for the URL to work.

### Slug hierarchy

`country/state/city/top-category/sub-category`

- **Strict order, block-contiguous.** Never reorder. No gaps inside the location chain (country→state→city) or the category pair (top→sub); the location block may meet the category block at any level.
- **A sub-sub filename (`master_id != 0`) takes the sub slot, replacing its parent sub** — never three category segments.
- **A city segment always follows its state** — city names collide across states.
- **No leading slash on the slug itself** (the full URL starts with `/`).
- **Slugs are case-sensitive lowercase**, exactly as returned by the list tools.
- **Prefer the most specific slug-hierarchy you can verify.** Country+state+city+top beats state+top beats top alone.

Valid combinations include (non-exhaustive):

- `top` alone
- `top/sub`
- `state/top`
- `state/top/sub`
- `state/city/top`
- `state/city/top/sub`
- `country/state/top`
- `country/state/city/top`
- `country/state/city/top/sub`
- `state` / `state/city` / `country` / `country/state` / `country/state/city` — location only

Invalid combinations:

- Skipped middle segment (e.g. `country/city/top` — state missing between country and city)
- Wrong order (e.g. `top/state/city`)

### Discovery lookups

Every slug segment MUST come from a live list-tool return. LIKE wildcards: `X%` or `%X` only, never `%X%` — BD's WAF strips one `%`.

**Categories — once per run, both levels:**

```
listTopCategories limit=100
listSubCategories limit=100
```

`total_pages: 1` → the full tree is cached; semantic-match the topic against it (a weightlifting topic matches "Strength Training" — keyword filters cannot make that match). Sites with one generic top (e.g. "Members") carry the real taxonomy at sub/sub-sub level (`master_id`). `total_pages > 1` → do NOT page; probe with `property=name property_value=<keyword> property_operator=contains limit=10` per distinct topic keyword (max 3). Slugs come from the returned `filename`; subs scope to a resolved top via `profession_id`.

**Member-count gate (every Pattern 6 URL):**

Category-only URLs (top alone, or top/sub):

```
searchUsers pid=<profession_id> (+ tid=<service_id>) limit=1
```

Location-bearing URLs (`searchUsers` cannot filter location):

```
listUsers property=[<location fields>(, profession_id)] limit=1
```

Location fields per `Rule: Compound filters`: city URLs filter `city` + `state_code`; state URLs `state_code`; country URLs `country_code`. Filter values come from the cached discovery rows: `city` = `city_ln`, `state_code` = `state_sn`, `country_code` = the row's `country_code`. Add `profession_id` when the URL has a category segment. This proves the top only — a location URL with a sub segment passes via the `URL liveness gate` instead (its fetch status is definitive: 200 = seeded, 404 = not). Link only when the count is `>= 1` — BD serves unseeded directory pages with a 404 status by design. Otherwise pick a different category or Pattern. Cache verdicts per run. Gate rows verify counts only — never recycle a returned member row as a Pattern 4 link target.

**Country:**

```
listCountries property=country_name property_value=<country>% property_operator=like limit=5
```

Slug = lowercase country_name with hyphens (e.g. "United States" → `united-states`). No `filename` field exists on this resource.

**State:**

```
listStates property=state_sn property_value=<2-letter-code> property_operator=eq
```

Slug = `state_filename` from the return.

**City:**

```
listCities property=city_ln property_value=<city>% property_operator=like limit=10
```

Slug = `city_filename` from the return.

### Per-run caching

- Resolved `<country, state, city>` triples cache once per skill run. Reuse for every link to the same location.
- Resolved `<keyword → top/sub filename>` mappings cache once per skill run. Reuse for every link to the same category.
- Never re-lookup the same value twice in one run.

### Anti-fabrication (mandatory)

- Every slug segment MUST come from a list-tool return.
- Never invent slugs.
- If ANY segment lookup returns zero matches, fall back to Pattern 5 (the bare directory landing) — at most once per post per METHODOLOGY `Link order` — or omit the link.
- A Pattern 5 link is always safer than a fabricated `/austin/running-coach` URL that 404s.

### Examples

- `/united-states/new-york/new-york/running-coach` — country + state + city + top
- `/california/los-angeles/yoga-instructor` — state + city + top (country omitted)
- `/running-coach/marathon-training` — top + sub (location-agnostic)
- `/personal-trainer` — bare top-cat fallback when location lookups fail or aren't applicable
- `/brazil/personal-trainer` — country + top (state/city omitted when the post's location is country-level only)

### When to use Pattern 6 vs Pattern 5

- **Use Pattern 6** when the post body names BOTH a specific category AND a verifiable location, OR a specific category alone with a verifiable top/sub slug, OR a verifiable location alone.
- **Use Pattern 5** when no verifiable category or location fits the sentence. Anchor text still names who the page lists ("local personal trainers"), never site furniture ("our directory," "browse trainers").
- **When in doubt, Pattern 5 is the safer default.**

## Internal vs external link attributes

Classify by host comparison against `getSiteInfo.full_url`. Relative URLs (start with `/`) are always internal.

| Type | Format |
|---|---|
| Internal | `<a href="/..." title="<descriptive>">text</a>` (no rel, no target) |
| External | `<a href="https://..." title="<descriptive>" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">text</a>` |

**`title` attribute required on every `<a>` in post body content** (`post_content`, `group_desc`). Short descriptive phrase (~50-80 chars) of what the link points to — not a duplicate of the anchor text, never an instruction ("Browse...", "Check..."). Example: anchor "certified personal trainers in Boston" → `title="Certified personal trainers in Boston by category and specialty"`. Helps screen readers, hover previews, and SEO.

**Anchor text: 2-5 word noun phrase that reads as part of the sentence — internal and external alike.** The longer description belongs in `title`, never in the anchor. Never the target's full title, never generic ("here", "this page"), never site furniture or page-type nouns ("member directory", "full jobs board", "the events calendar"). The anchor names the destination's content qualified by the post's topic ("Los Angeles fitness expos" for a fitness expo post), not the raw category label and not the page. External anchors carry the source's name ("the IATBP member portal", not "member portal").

## Composition examples (substitute `data_filename` for prefix)

```
/events
/events?category[]=Live%20Music
/events?lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality
/events?daterange=06%2F15%2F2026+-+06%2F15%2F2026
/events?category[]=Live%20Music&lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality
/events?lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality&daterange=06%2F15%2F2026+-+06%2F17%2F2026
/events?category[]=Live%20Music&lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality&daterange=06%2F15%2F2026+-+06%2F17%2F2026
```

## Don't

- Hardcode `/events` (read `data_filename` live).
- Use `+` for spaces in `category[]`.
- Trailing slashes (BD doesn't use them).
- Double-encode `post_filename` (already URL-safe).
- Mix protocols (use `getSiteInfo.full_url` protocol).
- Invent geo params. Only `lat`+`lng`+`location_value`+`location_type` (sent together — `location_type` required) filter by location. `state_sn`, `state`, `country`, `city`, `region`, `zip` as raw query params are NOT supported — BD ignores them and the URL filters nothing. Anchor text must match the URL granularity: if `location_type=locality` (city-level), say the city in the link text; if `location_type=postal_code` (ZIP-level), say the city + ZIP. `location_value` is display-facing (`lat`/`lng` drive the filter) — give it the granularity's clean string ("Los Angeles, CA"), never a street address. Do not say "in [State]" or "in [Country]" — state/country are not supported filter modes.
- Build links to WebPage-backed URLs that require `listWebPages` discovery (custom `list_seo` pages with arbitrary slugs, hand-built WebPages) — those are `/bd:seo` territory. **Pattern 6 slug-hierarchy URLs are NOT in this category** — they're constructed from live list-tool lookups, no `listWebPages` call needed.
- Bulk-list existing posts to "see what's available" for internal linking. Pattern 3 URLs are constructed from the current post's own category + location values — no lookup needed.

## Internal-link variety (SEO)

In the linking pass, vary the shape of filtered-listing links across posts so posts don't all point at the same pages. Per post, pick from: (a) category-only, (b) location-only, (c) category+location combined. 1-3 filtered-listing links per post within the broader internal-link budget set by the content-type file — distributed across intro, middle, and later sections, never clustered at the end. LLM-judged per post; no fixed rotation. Filtered-listing links use Pattern 3 (post listings) or Pattern 6 (member directory) per their respective construction rules. Link order rule (internal first, external later) lives in METHODOLOGY `Link order` subsection.

## Link shape priority (SEO ranking, universal)

Resolve each internal link to the most specific verifiable target the draft's own nouns support, top-down — drop a tier only when the one above has no target:

1. **Category + location combo** — highest SEO value. Tightest user intent match. Example for events: same category + same city. Example for jobs: same role + same city. Example for blogs: a Pattern 6 link to the member directory filtered to the member category the topic serves + the post's city (an article mentioning personal trainers in Los Angeles → `/california/los-angeles/personal-trainer`).
2. **Single-filter category-only** OR **single-filter location-only** — medium value. Use when only one dimension is naturally relevant in the sentence. A specific related post (Pattern 1) counts at this tier when its topic matches the mention.
Bare, unfiltered pages (`/search`, the directory landing, a naked category slug) qualify only when no higher tier has a target, and never as either of the first two internal links.
3. **Location + daterange** (events only) — strong "what's happening near here that weekend" intent match. Combine with category for the tightest anchor.
4. **Date-range alone** (events only) — lowest. Carrier: a same-day mention the draft already has ("three other races share the July 19 date"). Skip for non-time-bound post types.

Combine across posts — every post doesn't need a combo link. Mix (1) and (2) shapes across a multi-post run so the run's posts don't all target the same pages.
